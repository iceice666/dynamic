# About Me

Hey there! I'm **Ghost** — a developer, writer, and lifelong tinkerer. 
I love digging into how things work, then rebuilding them better.

<StatRow stats={[
  { icon: "⌨️", value: "5+", label: "Years coding" },
  { icon: "🌐", value: "2", label: "Languages spoken" },
  { icon: "📝", value: "∞", label: "Drafts in progress" },
  { icon: "☕", value: "3/day", label: "Cups of coffee" },
]} />

## What I Do

I build things for the web and write about what I learn along the way. 
My work spans systems programming, web development, and creative coding — often all three at once.
