# About Me

Hey there! I'm **Ghost** — a developer, writer, and lifelong tinkerer.

## What I Do

I build things for the web and write about the stuff I learn along the way. My interests span across systems programming, web development, and creative coding.

## This Site

This blog is my corner of the internet — a place to share notes, tutorials, and the occasional hot take. It's built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and designed to be fast, minimal, and distraction-free.

## Get in Touch

Feel free to reach out through any of the social links in the sidebar. I'm always happy to chat about code, collaboration, or anything in between.
