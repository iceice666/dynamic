# Markdown Showcase

A complete reference of every markdown feature available in this blog. Use this as a copy-paste source when writing articles.

## GFM: GitHub Flavored Markdown

### Inline Formatting

**Bold**, _italic_, ~~strikethrough~~, `inline code`, and **_bold italic_**.

Smart punctuation is on: "curly quotes", 'apostrophes', and dashes -- like this --- are auto-converted.

### Links

[Internal link to Getting Started](/articles/getting-started)

[External link opens in a new tab](https://astro.build)

### Images

### Blockquote

> "The best documentation is the one you actually read."
>
> — Someone on the internet

### Task List

- [x] GFM support
- [x] Syntax highlighting
- [x] Math rendering
- [ ] Teleportation

### Table

| Plugin | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `remark-math` + `rehype-katex` | LaTeX math rendering |
| `remark-admonitions` | `:::note` / `:::tip` / `:::warning` / `:::danger` blocks |
| `remark-spoiler` | `||spoiler text||` inline spoilers |
| `remarkCollapsible` | `:::\|> Title` … `:::` collapsible `<details>` blocks |
| `rehype-accessible-emojis` | wraps emoji in `<span role="img" aria-label="...">` |
| `remark-breaks` | single newline → `<br>` (posts only) |

---

## Code Blocks

Code fences use [Shiki](https://shiki.style) for syntax highlighting. The language label and a copy button are injected automatically.

```ts
export function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

```python
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```

```bash
pnpm dev        # start dev server
pnpm build      # production build
pnpm check      # typecheck + lint
```

```json
{
  "name": "dynamic",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "astro dev",
    "build": "astro build"
  }
}
```

---

## Math

Powered by `remark-math` + `rehype-katex`.

Inline: $E = mc^2$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$

Block:

$$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

---

## Admonitions

Four callout types, rendered with distinct styles:

:::note
A **note** provides helpful background context. Good for "by the way" information.
:::

:::tip
A **tip** highlights a best practice or shortcut the reader might not know.
:::

:::warning
A **warning** flags a gotcha or something that commonly causes mistakes.
:::

:::danger
A **danger** callout is for critical risks — data loss, security issues, breaking changes.
:::

---

## Spoilers

Wrap text in `||double pipes||` to create an inline spoiler (click to reveal):

The answer is ||42||, of course.

Spoilers can contain longer phrases: ||The butler did it all along.||

---

## Emoji

Shortcodes (via `remark-emoji`): :rocket: :sparkles: :tada: :warning:

Unicode emoji wrapped with accessible `aria-label` by `rehype-accessible-emojis`: 😄 ✨ 🚀 🎉

---

## Heading Anchors

Every heading (`##`, `###`, etc.) gets a clickable anchor link. Hover over any heading on this page to see the :link: symbol appear. You can link directly to sections like [#math](#math) or [#admonitions](#admonitions).

---

## Line Breaks

`remark-breaks` applies to **posts only**, not articles. In articles, a single newline in source is treated as a space (standard Markdown behaviour) — you need a blank line or two trailing spaces for a `<br>`.

This line and the next are separated by a single newline in source.
In an article, they render as one continuous paragraph without a break.

---

## Collapsible Blocks

Start a collapsible block with `:::|> Title text` and close it with `:::` on its own line. The title supports inline markdown. Content inside supports full markdown.

:::|> Basic example

This content is hidden by default. Click the summary to expand.

:::

:::|> Rich content — lists, code, and formatting

Supports any block markdown inside:

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

```ts
const greet = (name: string) => `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

:::tip
Admonitions work inside collapsibles too.
:::

:::

:::|> Title with `inline code` and **bold text**

Inline formatting in the summary renders correctly.

## Repo Cards

import RepoCard from '$/components/mdx/RepoCard.astro';

Display a GitHub repository as a rich card. Fetches live data (stars, forks, language) at render time.

**Basic — auto-fetched title and description:**

<RepoCard url="https://github.com/withastro/astro" />

**With overrides — custom title and description:**

<RepoCard
  url="https://github.com/withastro/astro"
  title="Astro"
  desc="The web framework for content-driven websites. Supports UI frameworks like [React](https://react.dev)."
/>
