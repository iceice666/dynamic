# This is a Header 1

## This is a Header 2

These headers should just render as normal paragraphs due to our custom plugin!

Testing **bold**, _italic_, and `inline code`.
Single newline becomes a line break thanks to remark-breaks.
No trailing double-space needed!

Here's a code block:

```js
const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(greet('world'));
```

Unordered list:

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

Ordered list:

1. First
2. Second
3. Third
