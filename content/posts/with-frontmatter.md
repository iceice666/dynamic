This post uses explicit frontmatter for both `publishedAt` and `tags`.

Both fields are optional and independently omittable — you can specify one without the other. Posts do not support `title`, `description`, `draft`, `lang`, or any of the article-specific fields.

The first `# Heading` in a post body is rendered as a heading — unlike articles, there is no auto-extraction of title/description for post cards. Post cards show a plain text preview of the body.
