This post has no `tags` in its frontmatter. Instead, tags are extracted from the last line of the body.

The last line below matches `#word #word ...` — those words become the tags, and the line is stripped from the rendered output. Check the search index or tag filter to confirm `demo` and `posts` appear.

#demo #posts
